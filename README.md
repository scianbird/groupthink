# groupthink

Congratulations! Your PTO is approved, and you and your friends are headed off on a roadtrip, re-capturing the feeling of the Good Old Daysâ„¢

One problem, though. Where will you stop to eat? Oh, another problem. What about the roadside attractions you'll stop to see? Oh, and another! Someone really hates that song in your playlist. Pretty soon you won't be reminicsing about your favourite memories, and the memories of this trip will all just be decision-making ... "discussions" (we don't like to call them fights, either).

Here's your solution: groupthink! groupthink is an app designed to solve all these problems by offering chances to suggest and vote on decisions that need to be made on-road. Where are we eating? Well, let's check what won the vote! Your mate is playing Mambo Number 5 for the 16th time? Let's downvote it out of the playlist.

What's left for you to take care of? Well, to make it fun!
(And to keep an eye on the road, groupthink can't handle that part of the roadtrip for you!)

## The Thoughts

We began this group project by thinking of and pitching ideas for a problem-solving app. Given the context of this decision, the idea of "an app that helps groups make decisions" was a natural suggestion and won unanimously. We made a concious decision to design this app in a way that would utilise the features of previous assignment projects and build on what we had already created.

We created the user -- someone planning a trip with friends -- and wrote our user stories with them in mind.

## User Stories

ðŸ“’ I want to be able to add suggestions for the decisions we need to make (for example, where we should eat)

ðŸ“’ I want to be able to vote on other suggestions made by my friends

ðŸ“’ I want the suggestions to be ranked, so that the winning suggestion is visible

ðŸ“’ I want a fair way for any "draws" to be decided on

As is the case with the provided user stories in our weekly assignments, we also wrote stories for "stretch goals" that we would implement when/if we had the time (or in the future).

ðŸ“• We want the user to be able to create a new category for a decision to collect suggestions on

ðŸ“• We want the categories to be one of 2 "kinds" -- an organic/evolving category (for example, downvoting songs from the playlist) and a deadline-based category (those with a final answer, for example where to eat)

ðŸ“• We want a "final vote number" to determine when deadline-based choices are made (for example, in friend groups of 8 people, 8 votes would automatically end the voting time)

ðŸ“• We want different visual themes, so that different friendgroups feel the app "represents" them

ðŸ“• We want the app to be accessible with alt tags, ARIA labels and by keeping in mind user experience when choosing font/colours/etc

## The Building Process

Day One was mainly spent planning and assigning overall "roles" within the team. We all felt quite strongly that a solid foundation would help work on the following days be more efficient. We worked with Figma to create the wireframes, Google Docs to have a longform version plans and Trello to condense those plans into daily goals.

The repo was set up collaboratively (allowing us experience in merging/pulling/approving branches) and in the final hour of Day One we set goals for Day Two.

Day Two had the underlining goal of "have our minimum viable product complete and tested" and so we all worked on each "block" of the app - index, CSS and the database.
