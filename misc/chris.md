Chris:
  Planning was straight forward, no conflicts, hand to hand combat or rude words, for a moment I thought I was in the wrong group, ideas fomented from three directions and they all just merged into the plan. we managed to collectively build the database table ready for use the following day.

  Originally I put forward the idea of a single table, with the view of leaving the 'other' columns unused, This was my worst idea this week.

  By the time we got to the stand up meeting on the second day I had redesigned the table into two (we have categories and suggestions), and put this idea forward at meeting and we moved forward with a better database schema.

  We aimed to have the MVP up and running my the end of the day, but syntax snags slowed my progress down, along with the unfamiliar workflow, I have never used anything more than a text file for project management so Trello took a little time away from the coding. being new to using git branches. we got a lot of practice on that over the remaining time.

  We called in backup (Manny) to spot a missing s in headers, that had me stumpped for more time that I'd like to admit but other than correcting paths with the help of Joe during the deployment it all came together, In the end happy with the result, despite a fair bit of frowning and head scratching.
